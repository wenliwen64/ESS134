ESS 134 2013 Fall Task 1:  Fitting 1-D geochemical dataDue: November 1st, 10:00 AM local time.Given Ba profile and diffusivity for Ba in sanidine, perform the following tasks:1. Fit the data using an analytical solution to the diffusion equation.  This will involve the complementary error function.2. Demonstrate the goodness of your fit with both a plot of the best-fit curve and the data, as well as with an MSWD or Chi-squared misfit value.3. Calculate the age of the sample using that best fit value from the Ba profile.4. Calculate the apparent best fit diffusivity for the Sr profile, assuming the same timescale you calculated with Ba.5. Write a ONE page report (³11 point font, single spaced, 1-2 columns, >1 inch margins), with one additional page for figure(s) AND references.  In this report, discuss all of the above items.  Extra points will be given for discussing the importance of these results.6. Upload your final script(s) to be executed and graded.
